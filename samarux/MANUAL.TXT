| SECTION 1.01 |  SamaruX
+--------------+

NAME
	SamaruX - Unix-like shell for CP/M systems
	
	(c) 2014, 2015 FloppySoftware, Valencia, Spain
	www.floppysoftware.es
	cpm-connections.blogspot.com
	floppysoftware@gmail.com

SYNOPSIS
	samarux [arg ...]

DESCRIPTION
	SamaruX is a Unix-like shell for Z80 computers, running
	the CP/M operating system from Digital Research Inc.
	
	It has been developed with MESCC (Mike's Enhanced Small
	C Compiler).

OPTIONS
	The optional command line, is a command line for the shell.
	
	If you enter a command line, then SamaruX will execute the
	command and return to CP/M (this is known as CP/M mode).
	
	If no command line is given, SamaruX presents the shell
	prompt, waiting for user commands (this is known
	as interactive mode).
	
	In the interactive mode, enter the exit command to
	leave SamaruX and return to CP/M.
	
	In both modes, there is an optional profiling procedure,
	to setup your environment, according to your
	preferences.
	
	SamaruX has some built-in commands, and since version
	2.00, it has some external commands too.

EXAMPLES
	samarux               -- To enter to the interactive shell
	samarux cat file.txt  -- To execute the SamaruX cat
	                         command and exit to CP/M

NOTES
	See the topics in the manual (with man), to learn about
	its commands, options, profiling, compiling, etc.

| CHAPTER 2 |  ENVIRONMENT
+-----------+

+--------------+
| SECTION 2.01 |  Command line
+--------------+

NAME
	Command edition

SYNOPSIS
	Rules to edit command lines

DESCRIPTION
	An usual command line looks like this:
	
	   command arg0 arg1 arg2 ...
	
	To include spaces in an argument, enclose it between
	single quotes:
	
	   'This is a single argument'
	
	Environment variables can be used in the command line as
	arguments and they will be substituted with their values,
	if you precede them with '$':
	
	   echo Your name is $USER
	
	You can include more than a command in the same command
	line, by separating them with the ';' character:
	
	   cp letter.old letter.new ; cat letter.new
	
	A command line starting with the '#' character, it is a
	comment, with no effect:
	
	   # This is a comment, not a command
	
	You can redirect stdin (console input) with the '<'
	character:
	
	   ed < letter.txt
	
	You can redirect stdout (console output) with '>' or
	'>>':
	
	   ls *.c > mydir.txt
	   echo 'Buy some butler' >> todo.txt
	
	You can redirect the output of a command to the input
	of another command (piping), with the character '|':
	
	   ls *.c | more
	
	Or you can enter a combination of above.
	
	You can use the following control characters to edit
	the command line:
	
	   - To delete the last character:
	
	     BS / CTRL-H (0x08)
	     DEL         (0x7F)
	
	   - To delete the entire line:
	
	     CTRL-U (0x15)
	     CTRL-X (0x18)
	
	   - To retype the line:
	
	     CTRL-R (0x12)
	
	   - To execute the line:
	
	     CR / CTRL-M (0x0D)
	     LF / CTRL-J (0x0A)
	
	Be aware that in the case of external commands,
	if the variable BINDIR exists, SamaruX will
	search there the executable files.
	
	If the variable doesn't exists, SamaruX will
	search in the current working directory.
	
	To force SamaruX to search in another directory,
	prefix the filename with it:
	
	   a04:program
	
	To force SamaruX to search in the current working
	directory, prefix the filename with ':':
	
	   :program

NOTES
	Some commands (alias) have restrictions on above.
	
	Pipes are done using temporary files.

+--------------+
| SECTION 2.02 |  Environment variables
+--------------+

NAME
	Environment variables

SYNOPSIS
	Environment (& pseudo-environment) variables

DESCRIPTION
	Environment variables can be used in the command line as
	arguments and they will be substituted with their values,
	if you precede them with '$'.
	
	Pseudo-environment variables are not stored as environment
	variables, but they can be used in command lines as if
	they were.
	
	Some SamaruX environment variables include:
	
	  $BINDIR  - Directory for SamaruX external commands.
	
	  $HOME    - Default user directory.
	
	  $TERM    - Terminal name.
	
	  $LINES   - Terminal rows.
	
	  $COLUMNS - Terminal columns.
	
	  $USER    - User name.
	
	  $PROMPT  - Prompt string, with some special sequences:
	
	             %$ : $ symbol.
	             %u : User name (reads $USER).
	             %w : Working directory.
	             %% : % symbol.
	
	  $TMPDIR  - Temporary directory.
	
	  $MANPATH - Path for manual file.
	
	SamaruX pseudo-environment variables are:
	
	  $? - Exit code of last executed command (0 for SUCCESS,
	       1 for FAILURE).
	
	When executing batch commands, there are some additional
	pseudo-environment variables:
	
	  $0        - Batch file name.
	  $1 ... $9 - Batch arguments.
	  $#        - Number of arguments supplied to batch.

EXAMPLES
	echo My terminal is $TERM and I am $USER
	rm myfile.txt ; echo RM exit code is $?
	env PROMPT [%u in %w] %$

NOTES
	See related topics as batch, profile, terminal, etc.

+--------------+
| SECTION 2.03 |  File and directory names
+--------------+

NAME
	File and directory names

SYNOPSIS
	Rules to name files and directories

DESCRIPTION
	SamaruX accepts all usual CP/M file names, including
	wildcards (* and ?) with the usual behaviour.
	
	In addition to this, you can specify the directory in
	the file name.
	
	A directory can be named with its drive letter and
	user number.
	
	Also, you can use the diralias command to name
	directories, and use that name instead.
	
	If the drive letter is not included, it's assumed to
	be the current drive.(1)
	
	If the user number is not included, it's assumed to
	be the current user number.(1)
	
	(1) Be aware that in some circunstances, SamaruX will
	    search a file in another directory, instead of the
	    current one, if you don't specify it in the
	    filename (see the variables BINDIR for external
	    executables, and MANPATH for manuals).
	    To force SamaruX to search a file in the current
	    working directory, prefix the filename with the
	    character ':', as in:
	
	    :myprog
	    man :mescc stdio

EXAMPLES
	Legal file and directory names:
	
	a01:file.txt   -- File in drive A, user number 1
	2:account.dat  -- File in current drive, user number 2
	*.h            -- Files matching *.h in current directory
	b2:*.c         -- Files matching *.c in drive A, user
	                  number 2
	c3:            -- Directory on drive A, user number 3
	
	Using diralias to name directories:
	
	diralias root a0:
	ls root:*.x
	cd root:
	
	Illegal file and directory names:
	
	a:letter.doc  -- User number not included
	c:            -- User number not included

NOTES
	In some commands, a directory name is equivalent to
	all files in that directory (i.e. A2: means A2:*.*).
	
	See the diralias command, to know more about directory
	names.

+--------------+
| SECTION 2.04 |  Profiling the shell
+--------------+

NAME
	Profile

SYNOPSIS
	Profiling the shell

DESCRIPTION
	When running the shell, an optional startup file can be
	used to setup your SamaruX environment:
	
	profile.sx : For interactive mode.
	profcpm.sx : For CP/M mode.

+--------------+
| SECTION 2.05 |  Terminal settings
+--------------+

NAME
	Terminal

SYNOPSIS
	Terminal settings

DESCRIPTION
	The terminal settings can be controlled by following
	environment variables:
	
	  $TERM    - Terminal name: vt52, vt100 (or ansi),
	             ascii.
	
	  $LINES   - Terminal rows (> 0 and < 256).
	
	  $COLUMNS - Terminal columns (> 0 and < 256).
	
	When a command asks for terminal rows or columns,
	the procedure is as follows:
	
	  - If the environment variable exists and has a
	    legal value, this value is used.
	
	  - Else, if CP/M is version 3, the values from
	    the SCB (System Control Block) are used.
	
	  - Else, the default values are used (25 rows,
	    80 columns).

+--------------+
| SECTION 2.06 |  Compiling SamaruX and its commands
+--------------+

NAME
	How to compile the SamaruX shell and its commands

SYNOPSIS
	This topic explains how to compile the shell with
	its builtin commands, and the external commands.

DESCRIPTION
	To compile the shell (and its builtin commands):
	
	  1.Compile with MESCC - in CP/M:
	    cc sx
	  2.Optimize the code (optional) - in CP/M:
	    ccopt sx.zsm
	  3.Assemble the ZSM file - in CP/M:
	    zsm sx
	  4.Build the COM file from the HEX file - in CP/M:
	    hextocom sx
	
	Once you have build the shell, you must modify the
	file samarux.h, and recompile all the SamaruX external
	commands.
	
	To compile an external command (for example: less.c):
	
	  1.Compile with MESCC - in CP/M:
	    cc less
	  2.Optimize the code (optional) - in CP/M:
	    ccopt less.zsm
	  3.Build the REL file - in the host OS:
	    zmac less.zsm --rel
	  4.Build the PRL file - in CP/M:
	    link less [OP]
	  5.Rename the file from PRL to X - in CP/M:
	    ren less.prl less.x

NOTES
	To build the REL file, I use ZMAC version 03 Dec 2014,
	a Z80 cross assembler, downloaded from George Phillips's
	site: http://members.shaw.ca/gp2000/zmac.html.
	
	Of course, you can use your preferred tools to achieve
	the same results: emulators, hexcom, genprl, etc.
	
	See the source files for more information.
