INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a game for the Amstrad PCW and the Samaruc GUI.

It's a preview edition, in the sense that it's fully playable, but
there aren't a lot of levels.

Maybe, someday, I will find the time to write more levels...


GAME FILES
----------

ROSWELL .COM -- The game itself.
SAMARUC .CFG -- Samaruc configuration file.
SAMARUC .KEY -- Keyboard configuration file for Samaruc (optional).

The files SAMARUC.CFG and SAMARUC.KEY are shared by all Samaruc programs.

USING THE MOUSE
---------------

If you have a mouse, you have to configure it in order to use it in this
program.

See SAMARUC section in this document.


THE GAME
--------

Roswell, July 1947.

One night, an U.F.O. crashed near a farm in New Mexico.

Soldiers and O.S.S. agents got there soon.

The only U.F.O. survivor was arrested and taken to a
top secret underground military base.

The government told the public opinion that the crashed
object was a weather balloon...

You are the alien, my friend.


HOW TO PLAY
-----------

Keys to play the game:

[LEFT ] To move to the left
        or to activate something.

[RIGHT] To move to the right
        or to activate something.

[UP   ] To move up through a TUBE
        to eat something,
        to activate a TRIP transporter
        or to EXIT to another level.

[DOWN ] To move down through a TUBE.

You have to get (or eat?) the... uh? rounded things? before you
can go to another level.

Why, ask you? Well... I don't know yet. 

The level name is printed on the panel.

Do you want more information? Well, it's time
to learn along the way...

Good luck!


TECHNICAL NOTES
---------------

This program was developed using MESCC (Mike's Enhanced Small C Compiler - my
own version of Small C), and SAMARUC libraries (my GUI / Graphical User
Interface for the Amstrad PCW).


SAMARUC
-------

Samaruc is my GUI / Graphical User Interface project for the Amstrad PCW.

It was developed using MESCC (Mike's Enhanced Small C Compiler - my
own version of Small C) and Z80ASMUK and M80 assemblers.

It supports mouse, windows, buttons, screen saver, etc.

You can enter to THE SAMARUC CONTROL PANEL by selecting the "Samaruc"
option in the menu bar, that allows to change some GUI options as mouse
type and speed, screen saver, sound, etc.

It's not necessary to have a mouse to use the GUI, and you can emulate it
with the keyboard, if you select the option in the CONTROL PANEL:

UP           -- press [ALT] + [W]
DOWN         -- press [ALT] + [S]
LEFT         -- press [ALT] + [Q]
RIGHT        -- press [ALT] + [E]
LEFT  BUTTON -- press [ALT] + [Z]
RIGHT BUTTON -- press [ALT] + [X]

Also, you can enter the CP/M command:

SETKEYS SAMARUC.KEY

to configure the keyboard in order to help with the mouse emulation:

UP            -- press [ALT] + [UP]
DOWN          -- press [ALT] + [DOWN]
LEFT          -- press [ALT] + [LEFT]
RIGHT         -- press [ALT] + [RIGHT]
LEFT  BUTTON  -- press [ALT] + [SHIFT] + [LEFT] or [ALT] + [RETURN]
RIGHT BUTTON  -- press [ALT] + [SHIFT] + [RIGHT]

Some programs (like DeskJoy, The Same Game or Find that mine!) can allow
to use the MOUSE with the keyboard in a more simple way (normally, by
pressing the ARROW, RETURN and ESC keys).

To select an item (a button, a menu option, a check box...), press the
underlined letter, or the left mouse button while the pointer is over it.

In a menu, you can use also the UP, DOWN and RETURN keys to select an
option, or EXIT to quit.

Special buttons in windows and dialog boxes:

(Ok    ) -- press RETURN
(Cancel) -- press EXIT
