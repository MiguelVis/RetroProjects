INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a clon (well, more or less) of SameGame, a tile-matching puzzle
video game, originally released under the name Chain Shot! in 1985 by
Kuniaki Moribe (Morisuke) - according to Wikipedia.


GAME FILES
----------

SAMEGAME.COM -- Command to run the game in CP/M.
SAMEGAME.SCO -- File with score records table.
SAMEGAME.TXT -- Help file in english.
SAMARUC .CFG -- Samaruc configuration file.
SAMARUC .KEY -- Keyboard configuration file for Samaruc (optional).

The files SAMARUC.CFG and SAMARUC.KEY are shared by all Samaruc programs.


USING THE MOUSE
---------------

If you have a mouse, you have to configure it in order to use it in this
program.

See SAMARUC section in this document.


THE GAME
--------

The object of the game is to remove all the blocks of the board.

You can select just one block, or a group of blocks of the same type.

The columns will be placed centered on the bottom side of the board.

The partial score is the square of the amount of selected blocks
and the special BONUS block multiplies that result by 10.


HOW TO PLAY
-----------

You can play with the mouse or the keyboard.

To move the pointer, you can use the mouse, or the ARROW (UP, DOWN,
LEFT, RIGHT) keys.

To make a selection of the blocks you want to remove, press the left
mouse button, or the RETURN key.

After the selection, you can change of mind, and select another group
of blocks, or, if you are sure, you can remove these blocks by
pressing again the left mouse button or the RETURN key.


TECHNICAL NOTES
---------------

This program was developed using MESCC (Mike's Enhanced Small C Compiler - my
own version of Small C), and SAMARUC libraries (my GUI / Graphical User
Interface for the Amstrad PCW).


As I said, this is my GUI / Graphical User Interface for the Amstrad PCW.

It was developed using MESCC (Mike's Enhanced Small C Compiler - my
own version of Small C) and Z80ASMUK and M80 assemblers.

It supports mouse, windows, buttons, screen saver, etc.

You can enter to THE SAMARUC CONTROL PANEL by selecting the "Samaruc"
option in the menu bar, that allows to change some GUI options as mouse
type and speed, screen saver, sound, etc.

It's not necessary to have a mouse to use the GUI, and you can emulate it
with the keyboard, if you select the option in the CONTROL PANEL:

UP           -- press [ALT] + [W]
DOWN         -- press [ALT] + [S]
LEFT         -- press [ALT] + [Q]
RIGHT        -- press [ALT] + [E]
LEFT  BUTTON -- press [ALT] + [Z]
RIGHT BUTTON -- press [ALT] + [X]

Also, you can enter the CP/M command:

SETKEYS SAMARUC.KEY

to configure the keyboard in order to help with the mouse emulation:

UP            -- press [ALT] + [UP]
DOWN          -- press [ALT] + [DOWN]
LEFT          -- press [ALT] + [LEFT]
RIGHT         -- press [ALT] + [RIGHT]
LEFT  BUTTON  -- press [ALT] + [SHIFT] + [LEFT] or [ALT] + [RETURN]
RIGHT BUTTON  -- press [ALT] + [SHIFT] + [RIGHT]

Some programs (like DeskJoy, The Same Game or Find that mine!) can allow
to use the MOUSE with the keyboard in a more simple way (normally, by
pressing the ARROW, RETURN and ESC keys).

To select an item (a button, a menu option, a check box...), press the
underlined letter, or the left mouse button while the pointer is over it.

In a menu, you can use also the UP, DOWN and RETURN keys to select an
option, or EXIT to quit.

Special buttons in windows and dialog boxes:

(Ok    ) -- press RETURN
(Cancel) -- press EXIT
