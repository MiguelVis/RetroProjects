INTRODUCTION
------------

QJT can read an HTML file and print its contents on the screen.

It supports text justification, bold, underline and italic, but no graphics.

It runs under Samaruc, my GUI project for the Amstrad PCW.


FILES
-----

QJT     .COM -- The program itself.
QJT     .HTM -- A small test.
QJT     .TXT -- This file.
SAMARUC .CFG -- Samaruc configuration file.
SAMARUC .KEY -- File for SETKEYS to help with the mouse emulation
                by keyboard in Samaruc (optional).

The files SAMARUC.CFG and SAMARUC.KEY are shared by all Samaruc programs.


USE
---

In the CP/M command line, enter:

        QJT filename.htm   -- to read the HTML file.

or:

        QJT                -- to enter to the QJT main screen.

For example:

        QJT QJT.HTM


TECHNICAL NOTES
---------------

This program was developed using MESCC (Mike's Enhanced Small C Compiler - my
own version of Small C), and SAMARUC libraries (my GUI / Graphical User
Interface for the Amstrad PCW).


SAMARUC
-------

Samaruc is my GUI / Graphical User Interface project for the Amstrad PCW.

It was developed using MESCC (Mike's Enhanced Small C Compiler - my
own version of Small C) and Z80ASMUK and M80 assemblers.

It supports mouse, windows, buttons, screen saver, etc.

You can enter to THE SAMARUC CONTROL PANEL by selecting the "Samaruc"
option in the menu bar, that allows to change some GUI options as mouse
type and speed, screen saver, sound, etc.

It's not necessary to have a mouse to use the GUI, and you can emulate it
with the keyboard, if you select the option in the CONTROL PANEL:

UP           -- press [ALT] + [W]
DOWN         -- press [ALT] + [S]
LEFT         -- press [ALT] + [Q]
RIGHT        -- press [ALT] + [E]
LEFT  BUTTON -- press [ALT] + [Z]
RIGHT BUTTON -- press [ALT] + [X]

Also, you can enter the CP/M command:

        SETKEYS SAMARUC.KEY

to configure the keyboard in order to help you with the mouse emulation:

UP            -- press [ALT] + [UP]
DOWN          -- press [ALT] + [DOWN]
LEFT          -- press [ALT] + [LEFT]
RIGHT         -- press [ALT] + [RIGHT]
LEFT  BUTTON  -- press [ALT] + [SHIFT] + [LEFT] or [ALT] + [RETURN]
RIGHT BUTTON  -- press [ALT] + [SHIFT] + [RIGHT]

Some programs (like DeskJoy, The Same Game or Find that mine!) can allow
to use the MOUSE POINTER with the keyboard in a more simple way (normally,
by pressing the ARROW, RETURN and ESC keys).

To select an item (a button, a menu option, a check box...), press the
underlined letter, or the left mouse button while the pointer is over it.

In a menu, you can use also the UP, DOWN and RETURN keys to select an
option, or EXIT to quit.

Special buttons in windows and dialog boxes:

(Ok    ) -- press RETURN
(Cancel) -- press EXIT
