INTRODUCTION
------------

DeskJoy is a simple desktop utility for the Amstrad PCW, that enables
to run programs from it.

It has the ability to create, modify and delete links to these programs.

It has some internal programs too.

It uses Samaruc, my GUI / Graphical User Interface.


FILES
-----

DESKJOY.COM -- The program itself.
DESKJOY.LNK -- Links information file.
SAMARUC.CFG -- Samaruc configuration file.
SAMARUC.KEY -- Keyboard configuration file for Samaruc (optional).

The files SAMARUC.CFG and SAMARUC.KEY are shared by all Samaruc programs.


USING THE MOUSE
---------------

If you have a mouse, you have to configure it in order to use it in this
program.

You can use the ARROW, RETURN and ESC keys too.

See SAMARUC section in this document.


HOT KEYS

In addition to the options menu, there are some 'hot keys' to allow fast
access to them:

N: New link
E: Edit link
D: Delete link
M: Move link
R: Run link
P: Link properties

To use them, press the desired key.

TECHNICAL NOTES
---------------

This program was developed using MESCC (Mike's Enhanced Small C Compiler - my
own version of Small C), and SAMARUC libraries (my GUI / Graphical User
Interface for the Amstrad PCW).


SAMARUC
-------

As I said, this is my GUI / Graphical User Interface for the Amstrad PCW.

It was developed using MESCC (Mike's Enhanced Small C Compiler - my
own version of Small C) and Z80ASMUK and M80 assemblers.

It supports mouse, windows, buttons, screen saver, etc.

You can enter to THE SAMARUC CONTROL PANEL by selecting the "Samaruc"
option in the menu bar, that allows to change some GUI options as mouse
type and speed, screen saver, sound, etc.

It's not necessary to have a mouse to use the GUI, and you can emulate it
with the keyboard, if you select the option in the CONTROL PANEL:

UP           -- press [ALT] + [W]
DOWN         -- press [ALT] + [S]
LEFT         -- press [ALT] + [Q]
RIGHT        -- press [ALT] + [E]
LEFT  BUTTON -- press [ALT] + [Z]
RIGHT BUTTON -- press [ALT] + [X]

Also, you can enter the CP/M command:

SETKEYS SAMARUC.KEY

to configure the keyboard in order to help with the mouse emulation:

UP            -- press [ALT] + [UP]
DOWN          -- press [ALT] + [DOWN]
LEFT          -- press [ALT] + [LEFT]
RIGHT         -- press [ALT] + [RIGHT]
LEFT  BUTTON  -- press [ALT] + [SHIFT] + [LEFT] or [ALT] + [RETURN]
RIGHT BUTTON  -- press [ALT] + [SHIFT] + [RIGHT]

Some programs (like DeskJoy, The Same Game or Find that mine!) can allow
to use the MOUSE with the keyboard in a more simple way (normally, by
pressing the ARROW, RETURN and ESC keys).

To select an item (a button, a menu option, a check box...), press the
underlined letter, or the left mouse button while the pointer is over it.

In a menu, you can use also the UP, DOWN and RETURN keys to select an
option, or EXIT to quit.

Special buttons in windows and dialog boxes:

(Ok    ) -- press RETURN
(Cancel) -- press EXIT
