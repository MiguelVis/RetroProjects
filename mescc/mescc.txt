OVERVIEW
========

MESCC is a subset of the standard C language.

It was based on the version 1.7 (Oct. 1985) of Small C by Ron Cain, Mike Bernson's
and John Hill, but now only a little (if any) of the original source code is present.

This compiler can be compiled by itself.

This is not a C language manual, only a brief description of MESCC.

The present document assume that you have some knowledge about C programming language.


OPTIONS
=======

Usage: cc [name[.typ] [options]]

If no options are entered, a help summary will be displayed on screen.

Options:

-PRG          Out normal file ---- Type=ZSM
-LIB          Out library file --- Type=LIB
-ASM          Out assembler file - Type=ZSM
-O:name[.typ] File name for output
-Cflag        C source as comments?
-Eflag        Pause on errors?
-E:number     Max. number of errors to abort
-L:letnum     Letter and start number for labels
-S:size       Minimum stack size

Default options are: (flag is + for YES, - for NO)

        -PRG -C- -E+ -E:50 -L:A0 -S:512
        Input file type is .c
        Output file name is the same as input

NOTE: All programs must include the runtime file mescc.h first.

Examples:	cc hello
		cc myprog.c -s:2048 -lz1000

Then, if you want to generate a COM file, the compiler output (Z80 assembler)
must be assembled with ZSM.COM to generate a HEX file.

The HEX file output must be converted to a COM file with HEXTOCOM.COM
or HEXTOBIN.COM (or, if you prefer, with LOAD.COM or HEXCOM.COM, both supplied
with CP/M).

Example:	cc hello.c
		zsm hello.ccz
		hextocom hello.zsm hello.com

See ZSM.DOC for details about the assembler.

In theory, you can use any Z80 assembler (and linker) if the assembler output of the
compiler is compatible.

Note that some MESCC libraries can change their behaviour, by #defining some
macros like CC_NO_ARGS, CC_STDIO, etc., as described below.

There is an optimizer that analizes the assembler output of the compiler: ccopt.

Usage: ccopt name.typ [-td]

Options:

-td	Set the temporary drive. Optional.

Examples:	ccopt code.zsm -tm
		ccopt hello.zsm


SUPPORTED TYPES
===============

char		1 byte.
		Can be signed (-128 to 127) or unsigned (0 to 255).
		By default is signed.

int		2 bytes.
		Can be signed (-32768 to 32767) or unsigned (0 to 65535).
		By default is signed.

Pointers	2 bytes.

Arrays		Size of type * number of items.
		Arrays of pointers are not supported.

Examples:

char ch, *ptr;		A char and a pointer to char.
unsigned char c;	An unsigned char.
int i, *ptr_i;		An int and a pointer to int.
unsigned int ui;	An unsigned int.
signed int i;		A signed int.
char str[10];		An array of 10 char, 10 bytes.
unsigned int ui[5];	An array of 5 int, 10 bytes.

You can declare and assign one or more global variables in the same sentence:

Characters:

	char space = 32, tab = '\t';
	char lf = '\n';
	unsigned char cpm_eof = 0x1A, cpm_eos = '$';

Integers:

	int number = -32;
	unsigned int common = 0xC000;

Pointers:

	char *text = "a text";
	unsigned char *bytes = "a string";
	unsigned int *bdos_entry = 0x0005;

Arrays:

	char abc[3] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};
	char blanks[] = {32, '\t', 13, 10};
	char text[] = "a text";
	unsigned char bytes = "a string";
	int values[] = {12, -45, 68};
	int prices[2] = {2400, 1250};

As the compiler doesn't support arrays of pointers, the arguments of the
function main can be as follows:

main(argc, argv)
int argc, argv[];
{
	char *ptr;

	ptr=argv[1]; /* This is the first parameter */

	...
}

You can manage 'arrays of pointers' in a similar manner:

unsigned array[3];

array[0]="First";
array[1]="Second";
array[2]="Third";

int i;

for(i=0; i<3; ++i)
	puts(array[i]);


CONSTANTS
=========

Decimal integer		Examples: 32, -1, 456.
Hexadecimal integer	Examples: 0x12, 0xF3, 0xAA34
Character constants	Examples: 'A', '12', '\t'


STRINGS
=======

Examples:		"This is a text"
			"Text with a newline\n"


NAMES
=====

Variables and function names should consist of not more than
11 alpha-numeric characters.
The '_' character is considered an alphabetic character,
and the first character can't be numeric.


ESCAPE SEQUENCES
================

Can be included in character constants or strings.

\n	Newline, 10 decimal.
\t	Tab, 9 decimal.
\r	Carriage line, 13 decimal.
\b	Backspace, 8 decimal.
\a	Alarm, 7 decimal.
\f	Formfeed, 12 decimal.
\0	Null, 0 decimal.

The characters ', " and \ can be included in character constants or strings with:

\'	'
\"	"
\\	\

Examples:	'\0'
		'\n'
		'\''
		"\aError: Can't open"
		"Filename: \"%s\".\n"


COMMENTS
========

Comments can be written as follows:

	/* Comment in old style */
	// Comment in new style


SUPPORTED STATEMENTS
====================

for(init, cond, incr) statement;     -- init, cond and incr are optional, see forever loops below
while(cond) statement;
do statement; while(cond);
switch(cond) case statements;
if(cond) statement; else statement;
continue;
break;
return;
return expr;

A statement can be only one statement or two or more
statements enclosed in brackets.

Examples:

for(i=0; i<10; ++i)
	printf("Line number %d.\n", i);

while(i!=100)
{
	if(read()==0)
		continue;
	i=useroption();
}

do
{
	read();
	i=useroption();
} while(i!=100);

swith(i)
{
	case 10 : option10(); break;
	case 11 : option11(); break;
	default : optionerr(); break;
}

if(i)
	nonzero();
else
	zero();

return 32;

The statement for, accepts forever loop types - ie:

for(;;) {
	if(getch() == EOF)
		break;
	/* etc */
}


SIZEOF
======

You can use it only as follows:

sizeof(char)
sizeof(char *)
sizeof(int)
sizeof(int *)


OPERATORS AND PRECEDENCE
========================

! ~ ++ -- - * &   right to left
* / %             left to right

ABOUT THE SOURCE CODE OF MESCC
==============================

The source code of MESCC is written in MESCC code. That's is: A subset of C language
in Kernighan & Ritchie style, not ANSI.

Then, it can be compiled by itself.

To compile by itself, you must compile the file make_cc.c with MESCC.

See make_cc.c for more details.

The source code uses some extern library functions as fopen, fgetchar, etc.,
that are available as part of standard library of MESCC.

See main.h for more information.


LINKING MESCC OUTPUT TO MACHINE CODE
====================================

If a function is called: fn(arg1, arg2, arg3), the compiler pushes the
values of arg1, arg2  and arg3 on the stack in the order that they are listed
and then generates a call to a label "fn".

Values should be returned in HL, and 8 bit signed values should be sign
extended to 16 bits, and the simplest way to do this is to put the value
into A and call the routine 'ccsxt' in the library mescc.h which will do
this for you.

The stack must be restored to its previous state before returning.

The last argument will still be in HL when a function is entered,
so if a function has only one argument there is no need to get it off
the stack.

The functions printf, fprintf, sprintf, scanf, fscanf and sscanf, have
an additional value pushed on the stack, to tell the function how many
parameteres are.

Machine code functions can be put between #asm and #endasm directives.
