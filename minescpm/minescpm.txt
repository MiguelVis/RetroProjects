If you uncover a mine, you will lose the game.

There are three different levels.

In the level menu, you can exit the game by entering the command:

HOW TO PLAY
-----------

To uncover a square, you can enter a command telling its position as row and column.

E.G. - To uncover the square in row 1 and column C, you can enter:

A number on a square means that there are the same amount of mines around it.

To put or remove a flag over a square, you must append a F to the end.

E.G. - To put / remove a flag in row 3 and column D, you can enter:

	3DF
